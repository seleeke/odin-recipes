        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>We jokingly call these meaty, greeny, cheesy, beany, spicy baked chickpeas because, 
            well, <a href="https://x.com/karlimarulli/status/1782787627466338400?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">internet recipe naming conventions</a> make us laugh but I really think of them 
            as Pizza Beans 2.0. I introduced <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/09/pizza-beans/" target="_blank" rel="norferrer">Pizza Beans 1.0</a> in my second cookbook, <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Smitten 
            Kitchen Every Day</a>, where I dreamed of a mash-up of Greek gigante beans in tomato 
            sauce and an American <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/10/my-old-school-baked-ziti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">baked ziti</a>, with beans instead of noodles. I called them 
            “pizza” beans to try to convince my then-kindergartener to try them with clever 
            marketing. We still adore the recipe and all of the <a href="https://www.eater.com/24320621/luigi-mangione-pizza-beans-correctional-institution-huntingdon-origin-smitten-kitchen-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">truly unexpected</a> places it’s 
            landed.</p>

        <p>But to be honest, these are even more popular with the family these days. Heartier 
            with chickpeas, Italian sausage, dark greens, extra red pepper flakes for heat, 
            and a pecorino-mozzarella broiled cheesy top, the whole dish seems louder, and 
            even more filling. You can see that our default is still to scoop them onto <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/04/perfect-garlic-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">garlic
            bread</a> (also helps bring reluctant 4th graders to the table) but they’re also 
            fantastic, with or without the melted cheese on top, over polenta or even pasta. 
            It makes a big pan of beans and the leftovers are great — perfect for meal 
            prepping.</p>

        <p>Note: If your mozzarella seems wet or comes in water, drain it on paper towels for a 
            while before grating it so the final dish doesn’t become too watery. 
            Gluten-free: This dish is (of course) only gluten-free if you exclude the garlic 
            bread, or make garlic bread with gf bread.</p>

        <!-- recipe steps -->
         <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the meaty chickpeas</strong>: Heat large sauté pan — if yours is ovenproof, 
                you can even use it as your final baking vessel — over medium-high heat. 
                Coat with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and heat oil. Add onion and 
                garlic and cook until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add ground 
                sausage, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, 
                oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, breaking up the sausage with your 
                spoon into bite-sized pieces and browning them, about 6 to 8 minutes. 
                Add tomatoes (beware the splatter) and chickpeas and bring mixture to a 
                boil, then lower the heat to keep it at a simmer. Taste for seasoning; 
                I usually add another 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond brand) and more 
                black pepper here.
                
                <p>Simmer the chickpeas in the sauce for 10 minutes, or if you have more 
                    time, simmering them for 20 to 25 minutes softens them in a lovely way. 
                    If the mixture looks too thick, add 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup at a time, 
                    until you get a thick but saucy consistency. Add kale and let it cook 
                    until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. If you’re preparing the dish for later, 
                    or skipping the cheese on top, this is a great place to pause the recipe. 
                    You could even freeze it at this point.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>To finish</strong>: Heat your oven’s broiler. If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer 
                chickpea mixture to a baking dish. Scatter the top with both cheeses and broil 
                until the cheese is melted and browned in spots. Eat right away.</li>

            <li><strong>Do ahead</strong>: See notes within the recipe about where to pause. You can reheat the 
                chickpeas in a 350-degree oven for 15 minutes; I usually keep the lid on.</li>
        </ol>
