        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A few years ago, Alex and I started batching cocktails and keeping them in the 
            freezer. Batching may sound fancy and professional but at most we were 
            participating in rudimentary math (“one ounce? nah, one cup!”) and advanced 
            laziness (ahem, preparedness). Having cocktails ready to go and super, super 
            cold so that they won’t immediately water themselves down by melting ice was 
            a win. And, as the habit has continued, it’s always fun when a friend stops 
            by and you remember you already have <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/09/the-perfect-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">perfect manhattans</a> ready to go, as if 
            you were trying to medal in the impromptu hosting olympics.</p>

        <p>Most freezer-batched cocktails are straightforward: lukewarm going in, chilled 
            coming out. But earlier this year we made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_plane_(cocktail)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">paper planes</a>, poured them into a 
            jar in the freezer for later, got too tired to enjoy them (adulthood!) and 
            came back two days later to remember that (science lesson incoming, cover 
            your ears!) that lower-proof cocktails actually, uh, freeze when frozen. 
            Alcohol, as we probably learned a long time ago, has a lower freezing point 
            than water, which is why vodka kept in your freezer (aka you’re my Russian 
            in-laws) is pourable but paper planes, which contain both lemon juice and 
            lower-proof Aperol along with higher-proof amaro and bourbon — turn out to 
            get suspended in a perfect half-frozen state we call slush.</p>
        
        <p>But I honestly feel like “slush” undersells them. Here is a thing I’ve learned 
            trying to write frozen cocktail recipes over the years: It’s tricky to get 
            the texture just right in a blender. Too much liquid, or liquid that’s not 
            arctic to begin with, everything liquefies. Not enough liquid, nothing blends. 
            Ice that’s too chunky never homogenizes; ice that’s too small melts. Yet these 
            slushy paper planes are the texture I wish/dream all blender cocktails were, 
            with no blender required: thick but pourable with the most delightful crunches 
            of thin ice flakes everywhere. It’s gorgeous (thank you, Aperol, for the orange 
            glow), balanced (the bourbon smooths it, the amaro harmonizes it, the lemon 
            sharpens it), and feels like a popsicle in a glass and you did nothing, nothing 
            but pouring ingredients into a jar and forgetting about them for a day to make 
            it happen. We’re going to win at summer this year, and it starts with this.</p>

        <p><strong>Servings</strong>: 6</p>
        <p><strong>Time</strong>: 10 minutes to mix, then overnight or longer to freeze</p>

        <p>This is a simple 1:1:1:1 formula so it’s easy to scale up or down based on 
            the amount of the ingredients you have, your jar size, or intended serving
            size. I’m showing this in a 3-cup/24-ounce Ball wide-mouth canning jar, 
            so I used 3/4 cup (6 fluid ounces or 175 ml) of each ingredient. 
            Each drink is usually 1/2 cup (4 ounces or 120ml).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup bourbon</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Amaro Nonino</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Aperol</li>
            <li>3/4 cup lemon juice</li>

         <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix everything in a jar and place in freezer at least overnight and if you wish, much longer — it will not go bad.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, stir mixture so it’s an even slushy texture (it’s often partly soft ice and partly liquid) and pour into either tall coupe glasses without ice, or, as shown here, shorter glasses (8 ounces) with ice.</li>
        </ol>
