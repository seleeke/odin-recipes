        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Do you have a big, neglected cabbage in your fridge awaiting the right 
            inspiration? I had a feeling you did. The way I figure it, the sidewalks 
            are currently covered in pink and white petal confetti, the ramps are 
            here, and the asparagus is close, thus I’m crossing my fingers that this 
            can be our last hurrah with heavy winter vegetables until at least 
            November. We’re going to make it a good one..</p>

        <p>The origin of this recipe is, as you might have guessed, the godlike 
            invention known as salt-and-vinegar potato chips. When developing this 
            recipe, I first used this method to imbue thick potato slices with 
            vinegar and salt. Later, on a whim, I added chunks of cabbage, just 
            to see if they, too, appreciated a vinegar roast/braise, and what 
            happened next was that we neglected all of the potatoes to eat the 
            cabbage.</p>

        <p>I, too, was flabbergasted. The potatoes were good! But the cabbage was 
            better, way better. It stole the show. So I made it again with just 
            cabbage, and, look, I am not going to try to convince you that you’re 
            going to like chunks of charred-edged cabbage with some chiplike flakes 
            braised in vinegar with soft cloves of garlic and pats of butter, if 
            you are skeptical about these things. I know it’s not for everyone. 
            But if it’s for you, and I bet you know already whether it is, you are 
            in for one of my favorite ways to roast cabbage. It’s going to seem too 
            charred, too vinegary, too vegetal when you first pull it from the oven, 
            but the pan will not make it to the table intact.</p>

        <!-- recipe ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds (905 grams, or roughly 1 medium) green cabbage, halved, cored, then cut into 1-to-2-inch chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (25 grams) olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (3 grams) kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, lightly smashed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (80 grams) vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (80 grams) white vinegar</li>
            <li>Sea salt, to finish</li>
        </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
            <li>On a rimmed 9-by-13-inch baking sheet, toss the cabbage with the olive 
                oil, salt, and pepper to coat evenly, but leaving any chunks intact
                -that is, there’s no need to separate the leafy layers. Dot the butter 
                over the top — it will melt in the oven. Roast for 15 minutes, until 
                the cabbage is black in spots.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to turn the cabbage over and scatter the garlic cloves in 
                the pan.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and roast for another 15 minutes, until the cabbage 
                looks worrisomely charred (but it will be perfect, I promise). Pour the 
                broth and vinegar carefully into the pan, and return it to the oven a 
                final time, to roast for yet another 15 minutes, or until the garlic 
                cloves are tender and the liquids have been reduced to a thin (or 
                nonexistent) puddle. Finish with a sprinkling of sea salt, and good 
                luck not eating the crunchy bits right from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
