The Odin Project Capstone Project #1: HTML

In this project, I will be building a basic HTML website that contains three recipe webpages. There will be no styling here, as we have yet to explore CSS. Therefore, this will be as barebones as it gets. 

Through this lesson, I will solidify my knowledge about:
- Developing basic HTML code
- Adding absolute and relative links to webpages
- Adding photos to webpages
- Using lists effectively
- Using git and GitHub to perform version control and share web projects
